# Python-Practice-Problems
A repo for practicing programming interview problems, using Python.

== History

As I am entering my last year of my degree, I wanted to ensure that I take the time to
practice as many programming problems in preparation for interviews but also in order
to ensure that I continue to improve my coding.  I will also start to add information 
for timing in order to gain a rough estimate of how many hours I spend coding!
